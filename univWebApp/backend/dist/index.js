 NodeJS : Run JS code on your machine.
 Express : Makes working with servers and routes so easy 
 		(relatively easier than JS vanilal).
 API : Application Programming Interface
 REST : most popular api design pattern. A combination of DB resources, route paths,
 	and HTTP verbs to allow applications describe what action they are trying to 
 	perform.
 MongoDB : non-relaional db, scales well.
